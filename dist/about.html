          <h3>Simple Biography</h3>
          <h6>To be or not to be</h6>
          <p>
            Married for 5 years, I enjoy spending time with my wife and going on
            walks and hikes with our dog, Sami. I enjoy playing ice-hockey and
            golf. If I have free time, I search YouTube to try and learn
            something new. I enjoy reading and watching movies.

        <div class="job job-2">
          <h3>Work History</h3>
          <h6>Knowledge + Experience = Success</h6>
          <p>
            Between 2013-early 2016 I worked as a project manager for Dell EMC.
            overseeing the coordination of remote developers to onsite
            engineers. Since 2016 I have worked for doTERRA International as the
            Manager of their onboarding/training department.

          <h3>Career Aspirations</h3>
          <h6>Full Stack Developer</h6>
          <p>
            I would love to be in a position of constant learning. Seeing a
            project from early development through deployment is incredibly
            satisfying and I believe pushes developers to produce their greatest
            work.
